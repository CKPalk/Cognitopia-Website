            <p>
                We founded this company to help our younger brothers. Both of us grew up with younger brothers on the autism spectrum. Being on the spectrum can make some of the littlest things hard and it may seem like others don't understand. But we thought that if we could make some simple tools to take the stress out of some parts of your life, you might appreciate that.
            </p>
            <p>
                Cognitopia is based around the idea that simple solutions to everyday problems can have a large impact. We've seen these successes first hand and our customers love telling us about the ways we've helped them. We have you in mind when we make our products and if the apps don't solve your problems, we want to improve them so that you're satisfied.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tom has been researching how technology can improve the lives of people with autism and their families for more than twenty years. Matt's been trying to be the most helpful big brother he can be his entire life. We hope that you'll tell us how Cognitopia can help you so we can try to serve you better.
